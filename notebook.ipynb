The data sheet contains considerably more \\ndetailed information that is tailored to the application.  \\nInstruments and equipment have mechanical, electrical, and control specifications that \\nare written down on data sheets. The data sheets have information about the desired \\nspare parts. Usually, the vendor gives you the data sheets after you buy something \\nfrom them. Once complete, the data sheet  is delivered along with a request to many \\nvendors. When giving their estimates, vendors will list a variety of models and \\nmanufacturers.
